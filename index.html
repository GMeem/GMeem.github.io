		  <h6>What I Tell Her</h6>
		  <p>Ingredients 


			<br> - 3 cups of tattling on me

		
			<br> - 1 cup of wearing my old clothes that look too big on her
		

			<br> - 4 cups of being a know-it-all all the fucking time 
		

			<br> - 10 cups of sucking up to parents to show she is the best
		

			<br> - 100 cups of critisizing me for absolutely nothing

		

			<br> - 1000 cups of complaining about the privilages of being the oldest one, while completely ignoring the privilages of the middle child 

			<br> - 100000 cups of overdramatic-ness 
		</p>

		  	When she screams
			<br> She hides her fear
			<br> But I Hear Her 

			<br> When she complains
			<br> She means to ask for help
			<br> She hides my tears
			<br> She needs a shoulder
			<br> And I will be there

			<br> When I say I will be there
			<br> I really do mean it
			<br> But I’m afraid
			<br> I might not be enough

			<br> But no, she is not one dimensional
			<br> And no, this isn’t all her
			<br> she everything and more

		  	Your story will never end
			<br>It will continue writing itself
			<br>Your life opened
			<br>Your death ended
			<br>But your story will never end, until you do it yourself
